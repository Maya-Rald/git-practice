Hello! It's Maya.
This is just a test text, used for learning functions of GIT. 

I can write a bit about myself... 
I started learning programming since I entered to Keio University. 
Mostly I study Python for future use, but willing to study other languages.
My interest range is not limited to engineering. I would like to try various fields of jobs, especially like management consulting, marketing, and investment.

Loving to learn new things.
Loving to experience new things.

Nice to see ya!
